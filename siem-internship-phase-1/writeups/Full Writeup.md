Hello my friends,
This is Mostafa Essam (0xMOST) with you. Today, in this file, we’ll start talking about the steps and everything we did to set up this lab.
I'm excited as I write this, so I hope you're just as excited!
Let’s get started.

>  **Important Note:**  
> I did **not** use a static IP address in my lab setup.  
> As a result, the IP address **changed every time** I shut down and restarted the system.  
> The only thing I updated was the IP **inside Winlogbeat** to match the new one each time.
